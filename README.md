# BRIDGE_TIMES_to_CMAQ
Basic Regional Interpolation to Distribute Growing Emissions (BRIDGE) 

This script will simplify the process of running CMAQ based on the results of a TIMES run. This is specifically based on the US9rT database for TIMES, and US emissions data, but could easily be modified for other countries or databases.

Forthcoming manuscript describes use more completely, in the meantime message me for questions.
